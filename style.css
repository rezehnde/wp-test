Description:    WordPress Theme from scratch to show my abilities as WordPress Developer. I am a hard-working developer who is capable of working independently and with a team. My key skills are the capacity to focus and manage my time to accomplish difficult tasks. I am keen on developing my skills in a very rational company that uses technology to go beyond the limits.
